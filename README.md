# Mended Boats

Mended Boats enhances the movement mechanics of boats in Minecraft, making them move more understandably
and predictably. By accurately simulating boat movements on the client side, as they occur on the server,
players can see and react to boat movements more swiftly.

## Download & Installation

Mended Boats requires the Fabric mod loader. The `mendedboats-<version>.jar` should be placed in
the `.minecraft/mods` folder.

## Features

- Simulate Boats on the client like on the server
- Remove half-second smoothing animation of boat movement packets

## Setup for Programmers

For setup instructions please see the [fabric wiki page](https://fabricmc.net/wiki/tutorial:setup) that relates to the
IDE that you are using.
